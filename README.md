# Purpose of File System Organizer

If we have numerous files in a folder and they are not properly arranged ,
so we can use this tool to arrange them in specific directory according to their extension
like text files will go into the text folder and exe files go into the executable folder and so on.
So at the end, we will have arranged set of files in specific folders.


 Built in node modules like fs and path have been used to create this project.
